Vulnerability Assessment
Report
1st January 20XX
<br>
<h2>System Description</h2>
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on
the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management
system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts
with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.
<br>
<h2>Scope</h2>
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system.
The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP
800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.
Purpose
The database server is a centralized computer system that stores and manages large amounts
of data. The server is used to store customer, campaign, and analytic data that can later be
analyzed to track performance and personalize marketing efforts. It is critical to secure the
system because of its regular use for marketing operations.

<h2>Approach</h2>
Risks that were measured considered the data storage and management procedures of the
business. Potential threat sources and events were determined using the likelihood of a
security incident given the open access permissions of the information system. The severity of
potential incidents were weighed against the impact on day-to-day operational needs.
<br>
<h2>Remediation Strategy</h2>
Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only
authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based
access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in
motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users
from the internet from connecting to the database.
